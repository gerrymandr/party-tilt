# How partisan is your state?

This repository contains data and code for better understanding the distribution
of partisanship throughout the states, focusing on Senate election results. We
have included a Jupyter notebook that extracts Senate election records from FEC
summary spreadsheets, transforms those results into turnout-equalized average vote
percentages for each state, and produces some visualizations summarizing the content
of those datasets. You can view the notebook/ [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gerrymandr/turnout-equalized-senate/blob/master/AllFiftyStates.ipynb).
